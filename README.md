# Omega-Strength

Omega-Strength (abrv: Ohm-str) is a web application for strength trainers. It allows the users to record their training, track records, and compare current performance with those records. It was created in Angular, uses Firebases's Realtime Database (NoSQL), and is hosted by Firebase as well.

## Introduction

This project was created by me ([Nathan Foss](https://www.nathankfoss.me)) as way to exhibit my continuous learning of Angular. As a new grad, I figured it would useful for potential employers to see what I can do on my own. It also shows one of my primary interests: strength training. This application is also a tool that I use in my own training regimen.

The application was built mobile-first with an eye for simplicity. The functionality and interface are meant to emulate a strength logbook (of which many trainers still use). With the addition of material-design components, the application is very straight-forward.

While this particular version of Ohm-Str is no longer in active development, I am currrently rebuilding it in React. Much of the functionality is the same, though the stack differs. Check out the progress in my [repository here](https://github.com/nkfoss/Ohm-str-react).
