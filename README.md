## Bootstrap

Bootstrap (version 3) is installed locally for this project using:

```bash

npm install --save bootstrap@3

```

Then add it to your angular.json file. Find the styles array (should be near the top), and add "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" (double check the node_modules folder and make sure this path is correct).
